# My Python Learning Journey

Hi! This is a personal log of my journey learning Python from scratch.

## Why I'm Learning Python
I want to explore automation, data, bots, and possibly game-related tools like asset readers or dialogue extractors. I’m starting from zero and just following my curiosity.

## Tools I'm Using
- Thonny (Python IDE)
- GitHub (for documenting progress)
- ChatGPT (for help and explanations)
- Optional: Discord, JSON files, Regex, etc.

## Week 1 - Getting Started
- Installed Python and Thonny.
- Learned about variables, print(), and basic syntax.
- Tried simple string printing like `print(a + b + c)`.

## Week 2 - Exploring Logic
- Practiced `if`, `else`, and `for` loops.
- Started understanding `async`, `def`, and `ctx` from Discord bots.
- Tried some basic scraping and JSON parsing.

## Goals
- Learn how to build a basic Discord bot with embeds.
- Understand how to extract and organize game files or dialogue data.
- Create small tools that automate boring tasks.

## Notes to Myself
- Don’t rush. Learn step by step.
- It's okay to not understand everything at once.
- Keep shooting in the dark—but track where you hit.
